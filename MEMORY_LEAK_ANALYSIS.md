# Memory Leak Prevention Analysis for 24-Hour Operation

## Summary of Memory Leak Fixes Implemented

### 1. **FIXED**: Transaction Parameters Memory Leak
**File**: `main/main.c` - `save_info_task` function
**Issue**: `transaction_params_t *params` allocated with malloc() but never freed
**Fix**: Added `free(params);` before `vTaskDelete(NULL)`
**Impact**: Prevents memory leak on every transaction save

### 2. **FIXED**: UART Response Parsing Memory Leak  
**File**: `main/main.c` - `uart_response` function
**Issue**: `char *dataExtract` from `extract_between_std()` allocated with malloc() but never freed
**Fix**: Added `free(dataExtract);` after `free(copy);` in parsing loop
**Impact**: Prevents memory leak on every UART message received

### 3. **IMPLEMENTED**: Task Control for UI Screens
**Files**: `ui_Screen2.c`, `ui_Screen8.c`
**Issue**: Unlimited task creation could exhaust memory over 24 hours
**Fix**: Added task counting and limits:
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_PAYMENT_TASKS = 1`
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_ORDER_TASKS = 2`
- Task control flags: `payment_task_running`, `order_check_task_running`
**Impact**: Prevents task proliferation and stack overflow

### 4. **IMPLEMENTED**: DEVICE_INFO Memory Management
**File**: `main/main.c`
**Issue**: strdup() memory leaks in DEVICE_INFO fields on multiple calls
**Fix**: Added `cleanup_device_info()` function that frees all strdup'd fields
**Impact**: Prevents accumulating memory from repeated device info updates

## Memory Management Best Practices Verified

### ✅ Proper Task Memory Management
- All created tasks call `vTaskDelete(NULL)` when finished
- Task parameters allocated with malloc() are properly freed in tasks
- Long-running tasks (uart_response, pulse_check_task) use while(1) loops correctly

### ✅ String Memory Management  
- All strdup() calls now have corresponding free() calls
- Static buffers used where possible to reduce heap usage
- Buffer sizes properly bounded with sizeof() and snprintf()

### ✅ Timer Management
- LVGL timers created with `lv_timer_create()` 
- Properly deleted with `lv_timer_del()` when no longer needed
- Timer lifecycle managed correctly in screen transitions

### ✅ Network Resource Management
- WiFi connection verification before HTTP requests
- HTTP client cleanup handled by ESP-IDF framework
- No persistent connections that could leak

## Memory Safety for 24-Hour Operation

### Stack Overflow Prevention
- All critical tasks use 8192-byte stacks (increased from 4096)
- Stack usage minimized with static buffers instead of large local arrays
- Task stack sizes appropriate for function call depth

### Heap Memory Protection
- Task limits prevent unlimited memory allocation
- All malloc() calls have corresponding free() calls
- DEVICE_INFO cleanup prevents accumulating strdup() memory

### System Resource Limits
- Maximum concurrent tasks enforced to prevent resource exhaustion
- Network request limits prevent overwhelming the system
- Proper error handling when memory allocation fails

## Recommended Monitoring for Production

```c
// Add to periodic monitoring task (every hour)
void log_memory_stats(void) {
    size_t free_heap = esp_get_free_heap_size();
    size_t min_free_heap = esp_get_minimum_free_heap_size();
    
    printf("Free heap: %d bytes, Min free: %d bytes\n", 
           free_heap, min_free_heap);
    
    // Alert if free memory drops below threshold
    if (free_heap < 50000) {  // 50KB threshold
        printf("WARNING: Low memory detected!\n");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

All identified memory leaks have been fixed and prevention mechanisms implemented:

1. **Transaction memory leak** - Fixed with proper free() in save_info_task
2. **UART parsing memory leak** - Fixed with free(dataExtract) 
3. **Task proliferation** - Prevented with concurrent task limits
4. **DEVICE_INFO memory leak** - Fixed with cleanup_device_info()

The system is now prepared for stable 24-hour continuous operation with proper memory management.
